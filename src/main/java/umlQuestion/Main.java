//Question 9 - Do this first if you are about that life !!!
//
//Finally, code out the UML and answer the following questions inside main(psvm) based on the UML.
//
//    Create 4 Product objects/reference variables - coke, burger, batteries, and a car.
//    Create an array and store your 4 products inside of the array!
//    Without modifying or creating a new Product constructor - Give each consumable product an an expiration date right here in main
//    Use the printExpirationDate method to print the expiration date of your batteries
//    Now use the printOrder method to print all the products
//    Create an ArrayList of consumable products
//    Use the printConsumptionQty to print qty of each product consumed
//    All Products should get a 10% discount but Food products get an additional 10% while Drink products get an additional 20% off
//    Write a Testcase to make sure that your calculateDiscount() method works for CheeseBurger
//    Print out the discount off for each of the following: burger,coke and car by using the calculateDiscount() method
//    Check if the burger isEdible using the method isEdible()
//    Create a new CocaCola object/reference variable BUT of DataType Drink named drink
//    Invoke/call the consume() method on the drink object and print the results
//    Invoke/call the printIngredients() method on the drink object and print the results
